Project Objective: To achieve automatic-reply function on the social platform, WeChat, for a company publicizing itself and getting a better customer service. I utilized the itchat package and some Python basic function to build up this program.
Project Function: This project can not only record the information and messages sent by the customers but also can send specific message to customers individually, let them get a good feeling when experiencing with this Chatbot.
The function of this project also includes:
1) Password security
2) Manager Control
3) Public Account / Personal Card sharing
4) Make Statistics and Visualization
5) Set up particular message to particular person
###
Project future: We have some bugs in this program such as it will reply the same message many time, there's no option to let the chatbot only reply once.
Therefore, the prospects of this project would be:
1) Set the number of each message is going to reply for each person, avoid the repetition
2) Make the Data Visualization of the message received better like some WordCloud, and Scatterplot by Python
3) Achieve the automatic group chat objective, which includes copy the message from one group to another, and just like chat in the group with others
